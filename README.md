# sChallenge_WinForm
An .NET Windows Forms demonstration.
## Summary
Provides a basic windows form application to enter patient details for the Telehealth application.

**Note:** This app was completed as a side-project under a time-limit so some time-optimizing adjustments were made to provide basic system functionality.
## How to Run
**Note:** The Web API should be running before any app interaction to facilitate back-end operations (see sChallenge_WebAPI for details).

Download the repo and open the solution in Visual Studio. Click the green play button to execute and windows application should open to login screen.
